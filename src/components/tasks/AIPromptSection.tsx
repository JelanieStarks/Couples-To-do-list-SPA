Rephrase and prioritize the following notes into clear, concise, past-tense, objective-style tasks.
Assign each task a priority category:
- A1â€“A3 = Urgent & important (A1 highest)
- B1â€“B3 = Important but less urgent
- C1â€“C3 = Nice to do, low urgency
- D = Can be postponed or ignored

Format each task exactly like this:
[PRIORITY] Task description (assigned to: Me / Partner / Both) [Day of Week, optional time]

Separate each task with three dashes on its own line, like this:
---

Example:
A1 Finish project report (assigned to: Me) [Monday, 9:00 AM]
---
B2 Call plumber about leak (assigned to: Both) [Wednesday]
---
D Organize bookshelf (assigned to: Partner)

Do not include any extra commentary or numbering.
Only output the tasks in the exact format above, with \`---\` as the delimiter between them.`;
